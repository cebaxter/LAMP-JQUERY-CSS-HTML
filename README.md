LAMP+jQuery+AJAX/JSON/REST+html+CSS Coding interview
====================

This is a basic coding skills assessment for an interview.  A small simple project to show off your skills, and/or provide a starting point to learn the skills necessary to fill a particular position.

```
Skills required:    1. Git
    2. Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP - the basic LAMP stack
    3. jQuery/Ajax/REST familiarity
    4. html/CSS familiarity
    5. (bonys) Testing/QA familiarity

The content of this git repository is a basic skills test that gauges your ability to work 
with the provided materials to produce the kind of code required for a full stack PHP 
developer.  We are looking for someone with either the knowledge to create such code, and/
or the drive to learn the skills discussed.  The project is very simple, and should not 
take an experienced person more than a half an hour to complete.  If you are learning the 
skills required, it may take longer, but initiative is a wonderful asset in your favor.

RULES:
    0.  clone this git repository, and take a look at the included files.
    1.  Create a Mysql Database, user, and table based on the requirements.
    2.  Import the csv file into that database
    3.  Create a table view, with a detail view below in html/php (see mockup)
    4.  The table should be loaded via REST calls to another PHP page.
    5.  Clicking on a cell in the table should populate the detail view with the record 
        information and text.
    6a.  All elements should have id's/classes and should be in DIV or SPAN tags, all 
        style should be handled via a linked CSS file.
    6b.  The table can be a &lt;table&gt; tag, but extra consideration for an all-DIV   
        solution.
    7.  All data fetching and display should be via REST/JQuery/CSS.  Your Jquery version 
        preference.
    8.  Additional consideration for a button that executes basic jQuery code that tests 
        the functionality.
    9.  FINALLY, your code must be made available on github when complete (export the 
        MySQL database via mysqldump into a human readable .sql file) - for review.
    10. Additional consideration for a publically available website running your solution.
    11. All Javascript, CSS, services, should be in external linked files.

Materials:
    1. A CSV file containing some mock data (names and addresses, and note field)
    2. A screen mockup
    3. This description of the tasks required.

NOTE:  We are not concerned with your experience in any of the given technologies provided
 you can accomplish the task as outlined.  If you don't know something, use google and the 
 internet, and learn how to do it.  Plagiarism will result in you being barred from the 
 possibility of an interview.  It's not hard, just do your own work.
